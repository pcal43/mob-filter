// THIS IS THE ADVANCED CONFIGURATION.  SEE mobfilter.simple FOR THE SIMPLER VERSION IF YOU
// JUST WANT TO FILTER OUT A FEW MOBS.
//
// This file controls the spawn filtering rules for mob-filter.  For details, see the docs at:
//   https://github.com/pcal43/mob-filter/blob/main/docs/advanced-configuration-landing.md
//
// Note that this file isn't parsed with a true json5 parser; rather it's parsed with google's gson
// in lenient mode:
//   https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/JsonParser.html

// Stuck?   Consider using Chat-GPT or another LLM to generate a config
// for you.  You'll get much better results if you direct it to the json
// schema for the config file here:
//   https://github.com/pcal43/mob-filter/blob/main/docs/mobfilter.schema.json?raw=true
//
// Here's an example of a prompt that generates pretty a good result:
//
//    Please generate a json config file for the Minecraft mod "Mob Filter."  I
//    would like to prevent hostile mobs from ever spawning in the overworld above
//    sea level. I'd also like to prevent silverfish from ever spawning anywhere.
//    For reference, please fetch the json schema for the config file from this url:
//      https://github.com/pcal43/mob-filter/blob/main/docs/mobfilter.schema.json?raw=true
//
// If your existing config is having problems, you can also upload it to
// Chat-GPT and ask it to fix it for you.
//
// But if the robots are unable to help, you can also ask humans for help
// on the discord server at:
//   https://discord.pcal.net
